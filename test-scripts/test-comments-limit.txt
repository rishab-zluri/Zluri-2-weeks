This is a test comment to verify the 1,000 character limit enforcement. The portal should accept comments up to 1,000 characters and prevent users from typing beyond that limit. This comment is intentionally padded to approach the limit for testing purposes. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
